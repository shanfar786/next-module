<h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>

Cookies can be recognized by the website that downloaded them &mdash; or other websites that use the same cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has visited them before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES USED FOR?</h3>
<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how the Site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience. Cookies can also help ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>FIRST- AND THIRD-PARTY COOKIES</h3>
<p>First party cookies are cookies that belong to us, while third party cookies are cookies that another party places on your browsing device through Our Site. For example, Facebook will place a cookie on your browsing device if you click on the Facebook link when browsing the Site.</p>

<li>
<h3>WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DOES AIRVAYS USE?</h3>
<p>The type of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into one of ten categories: Strictly Necessary, Session, Secure, Performance, Functionality, Flash, Tailored Content and Targeting, Analytics, Zombie. In order to provide you with the best experience, Airvays uses the following cookies.</p>
<h3>STRICTLY NECESSARY COOKIES</h3>
<p>These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around the Site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, some services you have asked for such as payment submission can&rsquo;t be provided.</p>
<p>Session cookies, also known as 'temporary cookies', help websites recognise users and the information provided when they navigate through a website. Session cookies only retain information about a user's activities for as long as they are on the website. Once the web browser is closed, the cookies are deleted. These are commonly used on shopping websites or e-commerce websites.</p>
<h3>SECURE COOKIES</h3>
<p>These cookies help to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and protect user data from unauthorized parties. Mostly, the checkout or payment pages of e-commerce websites have secure cookies to facilitate safer transactions. Similarly, online banking websites use secure cookies for security reasons.</p>
<h3>PERFORMANCE COOKIES</h3>
<p>These cookies collect information about how you use the Site, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get error messages from certain pages. These cookies don&rsquo;t gather information that identifies you. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how the Site works.</p>
<h3>FUNCTIONALITY COOKIES</h3>
<p>These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or the region you&rsquo;re in). For instance, the Site uses</p>

<h3>FLASH COOKIES</h3>
<p>We may, in certain circumstances, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as &ldquo;Flash cookies&rdquo;) are employed to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser.

They are often used in online games to prevent users from cheating but have also been used to install malicious software onto a user's device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE?</h3>
<p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; or &ldquo;session&rdquo; cookie.
